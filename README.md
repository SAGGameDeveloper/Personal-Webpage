# Personal webpage - Sergio Abreu Garc√≠a

I am a freelancer videogames developer, and this is the github repository of [my personal webpage](http://www.sag-dev.com).
Here you can see my workflow and style as a web developer. If you are interested in my work, you can
contact me at this mail: sergio@sag-dev.com

## Built upon Jekyll

To achieve multiple languages easily I decided to use a static generator. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) allows me to separate
the content from the visualization/functionality/style. Languages are each one in its own folder, being
the structure exactly the same for all of them. Using 'includes' and Liquid features I can
select, depending on the language of the page, what folder is going to be used to inject the
content into the HTML.

## Using Jquery and Bootstrap

To achieve a responsive design I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), mainly in the navbar and collapsible menus (Work section).
Bootstrap is the most widely adapted responsive design technology nowadays; easy to use, solid and powerful. Still, its native
version lacks some features I needed. That's where Jquery comes into action, giving me the functionality to
do things like smooth scrolls.
