I have been a self-taught programmer for more than a decade. That's not going
to stop now, not ever. I'm always willing to learn more, to do more and to
be better at what I do. If you want to propose me a project, do not hesitate to

As for personal projects, I'm right now working on different things. I'm diving into Virtual Reality
developement, one of the most promising fields nowadays. I'm also learning more about front-end development using Jquery and Bootstrap
as my chief technologies. Furthermore, I have some Android [Java] applications being developed which I will deploy to
the Play Store when finished.
