A lot has been told about the history of the videogames industry, how it was
shaped and the path that led it to its current state. But there's still a lot to
talk about its deepest origin, about the machines that made everything possible
at its very start, conforming the very first console generation.

#### The first videogame
If you've ever Googled what the first videogame was, you've probably found a
lot of posts with completely different answers. On that topic, there's no clearance
at all. Some say it was Turochamp, even the machines of its time could not run
due to its complexity; others acclaim it was Bertie the Brain, although it
was not even an electronic device; Nimrod, OXO and Tennis for Two are among the
other candidates.

CHANGE THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Turochamp (1947): Turochamp was a program created by Alan Turing and David
Champernowne. It was developed for research purposes, but it was too
complex for the machines of its time to execute. Due to this, it was 'executed'
by a human acting as a CPU, so there really wasn't much video about this game.
- Bertie the Brain (1950): this is considered by many as the first
videogame ever, but it does not tick all the boxes of most videogame definitions.
It was a massive machine, we are talking about meters of longitude here. It was
designed using valves technology, and it allowed to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe
with different levels of difficulty.
- Nimrod (1951): the Nimrod was another quite big machine. Its original purpose was
not to entertain, but to show the abilities machines could achieve in the
resolution of mathematical problems. As it name indicates, it was designed to
play the game Nim against a human player, and it was exhibited in 1951 as part
of the Festival of Britain.
- OXO (1952): this game was created at the University of Cambridge as part of the
Ph.D work of Alexander Sandy Douglas. It was run by an EDSAC computer and displayed on a Cathode-Ray tube, which played Tic-Tac-Toe against
a human player
- Tennis for two (1958): this game was created at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory by William Higinbotham, which had previously been
directly involved with the invention of the nuclear bomb. Players could play
a simplistic version of tennis by moving a knob and pressing a button on an
oscilloscope, very similar to what Pong would present some years later.
- Pong(1972): even if this is one of the most well known to the general
public, it's is not a really good candidate to the first videogame.
By the time it was launched, there existed already many other options which could
have taken that place, including his younger brother Tennis for Two.
Still, it deserves the recognition, not because of being the first, but because
of being the first impactful one.


Thankfully, since we are here to talk about consoles, we won't have to deal with
that mess, let's just say that videogames were born around the 1950's, which is
a much more agreeable statement.

#### Time to change

Lots of people from different places of the world have taken place into the
foundation of the videogames industry. But it can't be denied that there were
two leading countries: the United States and Japan. The second would come into
picture a little later, but its impact would be so profound that two of the leading
console manufacturers of today are Japanese (Nintendo & Sony).

In the 1960's, EEUU was under heavy pressure. The WWII was starting to fade, but
its repercussion could still be felt as the Cold War's shadow was getting stronger.
Many social movements were starting to outbreak; mainly racial and gender equality.
This shaped an era of drastic changes: music was as crazy as it would get,
rock broke with the conventions and jazz experimentation was at its peak; psychedelic
drugs reached the general public; the hippie movement started to spread around the
world; GPS, Lasers, Internet (although primitive) and many other technological
feats were made possible. And while all of this [and much more] was happening,
someone came up with an idea that would spark the videogames industry.

EXPAND THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### The box

In 1966, Raphael Baer was the manager of the Equipment Design Division at
Sanders Associates Inc. Thinking about the massive spread of the TV technology
over the United States, and even the world, he came up with the idea of using
those devices for more than watching.

- He presented the idea to the company, and it was rejected. After a
- Between 1967 and 1969, the Brown Box would be developed under Baer's supervision.
- Magnabox purchase, public receival

The launch of the Magnabox Odyssey was the starting point of the videogame console
industry, the first generation was born. It was not as we conceive a console
generation nowadays. Consoles weren't programmed, they were just electronic
devices with the ability to read very primitive cartridges. The screen was
black and white, and the graphics were just points and lines. And, of course,
audio was way out of the picture.

#### Pong!

In this epoch, Pong (1972) was reigning the game. It was a massive feat, a lot of
arcade Pong machines were thought to be broken, just to discover after calling
the technical service that they were malfunctioning because no more coins could
fit into its storage.

Seeing this, a lot of electronic firms of the time tried to replicate the game
in a more distributable manner, trying to reach as many homes as possible. Soon,
they started pouring many different machines into the market. As expected, the
public interest was not as big as to spend hundreds of dollars these devices cost.
This lead to an increasingly saturation of the market, which in conjunction with
the arrival of the second generation, led a lot of these manufacturers to go broken;
this is known as the '77 crash.

#### Arcades CHANGE THIS SHITTY TITLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
