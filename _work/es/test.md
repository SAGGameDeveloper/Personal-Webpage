I started building this website in 2017 as a way to learn front end while
I build myself a portfolio. Originally, it was made upon
<a href='https://jekyllrb.com/' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a>
and the design was pretty boring. But in 2019 I decided to rebuilt it
from scratch using
<a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/' target='_blank'>Gatsby</a>,
therefore learning
<a href='https://es.reactjs.org/' target='_blank'>React</a>
, and improving my JavaScript abilities.
