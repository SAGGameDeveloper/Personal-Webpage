Hi, IÂ´m Sergio, I was born in Vigo, Galicia, and technology has always been one
of my big passions. When I was a child, I spent my days tearing apart every kind
of device, trying to understand how and why they worked like they did. With the
arrival of the Internet and the new technologies, that curiosity started to turn
towards the digital, and I ended up finding my great passion in software
programming.
