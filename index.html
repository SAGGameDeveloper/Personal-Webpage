Hi, I'm Sergio, I was born in Vigo, Galicia, and since I was a child, technology
has always been my biggest passion. I used to spend days tearing devices apart
just to understand how and why they worked in a certain way.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for all of us, I stopped breaking things and started building them instead.
I studied Game Development, but my interest got me to learn about many other different
subjects, from web development to cryptocurrencies and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
And now I'm finally focused on creating quality video games, using all the knowledge
I've acquired along the way.
