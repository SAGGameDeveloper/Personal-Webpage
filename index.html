Hi, IÂ´m Sergio, I was born in Vigo, Galicia, and technology has always been one
of my biggest passions. When I was a child, I spent my days tearing apart every kind
of device, trying to understand how and why they worked like they did. With the
arrival of the Internet and the new technologies, that curiosity started to turn
towards the digital, and I ended up finding my greatest passion in software
developing.

I've worked with many different techonologies, from Unity 3D to NodeJS, trying
to figure out what I liked the most. And now I'm finally looking to specialize
in the fields of Cryptocurrencies and Machine Learning.
