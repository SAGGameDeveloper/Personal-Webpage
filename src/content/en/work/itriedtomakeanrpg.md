This was my second mobile project, being my main objective to strengthen my
Android development skills while exploring
<a href='https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/' target='_blank'>LibGDX</a>
and
<a href='https://box2d.org/' target='_blank'>Box2D</a>
. The outcome is not specially interesting, but the development process was
enriching.
