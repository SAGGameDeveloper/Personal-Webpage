I started working on this webpage in 2017 as a way to learn front end
while building myself a portfolio. Originally, it was made upon Jekyll
and the design was quite boring. But in 2019 I decided to rebuild it from
scratch using Gatsby, so I could improve my JavaScript skills and learn React
while doing so.
