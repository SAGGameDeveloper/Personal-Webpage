				<h2>ABOUT</h2>
				
				<p>
				Hello! My name is Sergio, I'm a freelancer developer and translator.
				I started programming at the age of 11, driven just by curiosity.
				I couldn't but love it, from that moment on I have been programming
				non-stop. For some years, I dedicated myself to videogames development,
				experimenting with different environments and languages.
				</p>
				<p>
				Some years ago, I expanded my horizons and became interested
				in Android development and web development. That allowed me
				to adquire a much deeper knowledge of the technologies used
				nowadays. This is why I can move both on front-end and back-end
				fields, allowing me to become a Full Stack developer.
				</p>
				<p>
				While learning to program, I began to build a strong relationship
				with the english language. I started to use it for everything, until
				I came to the point where I had the ability to translate everything I wanted with
				no effort, so I started working as a translator.
				</p>

				This own site is, of course, one of my works as a programmer and web-developer. I find having a
				personal website is one of the best things you can do as a freelancer. It's the entry point from
				which people can know who you are, what you do and how to get in touch.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hence, the moment I went freelancer, the first obvious thing to do was this webpage. I approached it
				from a modern perspective; being elegance, minimalism and responsiveness the main pillars of
				the project.

				This was the first project I ended as a programmer. I started it when I was 14 years old
				and finished half a year later, working only in my spare time. Initially, it was done using
				GameMaker, but in the middle of the development, I decided to move the whole game to Unity. 
				Therefore, I learned C# and remaked the game from scratch using the [new] 2D features of Unity.
				I finally decide to publish it at the age of 17.
				</p>
				<p>
				Given the age I was and the experience I had when I did it; nor the design, nor the graphic design, nor
				the programming is an actual representation of my current abilities. Still, for the knowledge I had
				at the time, I find it to be an excelent proof of my vocation and dedication.

			<div class = "collapse work-element" id = "kidicarus">
				<p>
				While on college, a friend of mine and me decided to do a Kid Icarus reduced version. To do so,
				we used HTML, Javascript, Phaser and NodeJS. The whole project is available and open on Github,
				where you can also play it directly through Gihub Pages.
				</p>
				<p>
				The main focus of the development is on the programming part, as we were not game designers and
				that was not the point of the project. Being this so, our first priority was to make a solid
				and scalable software arquitecture while learning more about the technologies we were using.

				I have always been a huge lover of videogames and literature. Mixing those two at some point seemed
				to be a logical step on my path. Some random day, I found the opportunity to make a trial for a
				videogames digital magazine, no doubt I had to try. After passing, I started working as a videogames
				journalist.
				</p>
				<p>
				After 3 months, I found that was not what I have expected, so I quited. Even so, while working there
				I learned quite a lot about writing and delivering good quality content. Moreover, I had to translate
				quite a lot from english [news, declarations, interviews] to spanish, adquiring then solid translation skills.

				Here you have one of my finest works.

				I have been a self-taught programmer for more than a decade, and a self-taught translator for almost 
				5 years. That's not going to stop now, not ever. I'm always willing to learn more, to do more and to
				be better at what I do. If you want to propose me a project, do not hesitate to contact me!
				</p>
				<p>
				As for personal projects, I'm right now working on different things. I'm creating a tilemap editor
				in Python using Tkinter and JSON. I'm also diving in front-end development using Jquery and Bootstrap
				as my chief technologies. Furthermore, I have some Android [Java] applications being developed which I will deploy to
				the Play Store when finished.

				I have some unrelated to work facets you might find interesting.
				</p>
				<p>
				I have been playing videogames for 16 years, that's with no doubt my biggest hobby. At
				the age of 11 I decided I wanted to learn to make that I loved so much. So I started
				playing around with game engines like Scratch, RPG Maker and GameMaker. This, combined
				with my experience as videogames journalist, means that I have a very deep knowledge of
				the videogames industry from three different standpoints: developer, journalist and player.
				</p>
				<p>
				I'm very passionate for all strength sports, and I am myself a calisthenics athlete,
				here you can see what I do. I have been training for almost 4 years now, and even if that
				may not have a direct relation with my work, I find it a clean proof of my dedication
				to things I love. I also played basketball for 8 years and figure skating for 3.
